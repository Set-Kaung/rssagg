A follow-along of the tutorial created by [Boot Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@bootdotdev/about) on youtube as a side project. 
Since I was not familiar with Chi, sqlc and goose, this was a good learning opportunity for database migration etc. 

I use Chi as my router and goose for database migration. 
Sqlc for creating type-safe go code for db.
